                Matter is a place for things. It is an attempt at connecting all of the dots. It is ultimately the output of Liam and Cole. 
                It is a place for them to build anything that they feel is useful to themselves and therefore useful to the world. A mission to maximize
                enjoyment and self fulfilment. Balancing life and building tools to make it easier and more fun.
